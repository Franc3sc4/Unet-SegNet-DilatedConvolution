# Unet-SegNet-DilatedConvolution

The aim of this work is to compare the three architectures: SegNet, U-Net and Dilated convolution (based on CNNs), to understand their respective properties and robusteness when applied on diverse datasets for image segmentation tasks.
We applied them on two different datasets: an imbalance dataset (Massachusetts Buildings dataset) and a street scenes dataset (Cityscapes dataset). 
All the details can be found in the VCS_report.pdf report, we reported some key concepts image segmentation and the built CNNet architectures, finally we discussed the experiments we carried out and our results.
The best hyperparamenters used are already initialized in the jupyter files.
